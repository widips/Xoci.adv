- "🚀 Features"

A lightweight Windows application that allows users to launch and manage multiple instances of a game or program — even if the original software normally restricts multi-running.

This tool is useful for:
- Multi-account gaming
- Testing environments
- Sandbox setups
- Running multiple isolated sessions of the same executable
